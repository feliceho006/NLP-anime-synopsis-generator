Souten Kouros story is based loosely on the events taking place in Three Kingdoms period of China during the life of the last Chancellor of the Eastern Han Dynasty Cao Cao 155  March 15 220 who also serves as the main character  The Three Kingdoms period has been a popular theme in Japanese manga for decades but Souten Kouro differs greatly from most of the others on several points One significant difference is its highly positive portrayal of its main character Cao Cao who is traditionally the antagonist in not only Japanese manga but also most novel versions of the Three Kingdoms period including the original 14th century version Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong Another significant difference from others is that the storyline primarily uses the original historical account of the era Records of Three Kingdoms by Chen Shou as a reference rather than the aforementioned Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel By this the traditional hero of Romance of the Three Kingdoms Liu Bei takes on relatively less importance within the story and is portrayed in a less positive light Yet several aspects of the story are in fact based on the novel version including the employment of its original characters such as Diao Chan as well as anachronistic weapons such as Guan Yus Green Dragon Crescent Blade and Zhang Feis Viper Blade  A consistent theme throughout the story is Cao Caos perpetual desire to break China and its people away from its old systems and ways of thinking and initiate a focus on pragmatism over empty ideals This often puts him at odds with the prevalent customs and notions of Confucianism and those that support them  Source Wikipedia

This film stays very faithful to the original down to the smallest details save for the kangaroorat that suddenly appears twenty minutes into the movie and subsequently follows Aladdin around serving no purpose in the story but fulfilling the role of token animal mascot   The screenwriter needs no introduction Akira Miyazaki singlehandedly wrote five of the classic WMT series including Perrine and Rascal and participated in two others The only other name among the staff that rings a bell though is Yukihide Takekawa who was responsible for the music in the magnificent and unknown Unico pilot film   The story takes some illogical and confusing jumps at the point where Aladdin begins to court the princess and the extravagant animation that had characterised Toei films of the 60s when Toei had the best animators around had become a thing of the past long before this point but this is still an aboveaverage film in large part because of the screenplay that stays so faithful to the original The character designs are slightly more westernlooking than one is accustomed to seeing in anime   Source pelleasnet
